    "# IOU Tracker\n",
    "\n",
    "IOUTracker implements a tracking algorithm or method to track objects based on their Intersection-Over-Union (IOU) information across the consecutive frames. The core concept of this algorithm refers to the article (http://elvera.nue.tu-berlin.de/files/1517Bochinski2017.pdf). The idea or the assumption is based on an existing and powerful detector and the high frame rate across the consecutive frames. Under this assumption, you can conduct the object tracking with only the localization and the IOU information. The algorithm conducts under a super-high frame rate and provides a foundation for more complicated calculations upon it. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, such an algorithm requires an evaluation. The evaluation of this implement also refers to two articles, MOT16 benchmark (https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.00831) and Multi-Target Tracker (http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.309.8335&rep=rep1&type=pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation uses MOT17Det dataset (https://motchallenge.net/data/MOT17Det/) as an example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* More information please refer to https://github.com/jiankaiwang/ioutracker.\n",
